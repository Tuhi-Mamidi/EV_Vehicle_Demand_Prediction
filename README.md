In the first week, we began by importing the required libraries and loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. We then performed initial data cleaning by handling
missing values and standardizing column names where necessary. Next, we identified outliers in the Percent Electric Vehicles column using the IQR method and quantified 
the number of outliers present. Finally, we applied outlier capping  to reduce the
influence of extreme values while retaining all data points.
